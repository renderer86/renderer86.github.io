  title: "Persona Expansion with Commonsense Knowledge for Diverse and Consistent Response Generation"
  conf: "The 17th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics(EACL). (2023)"
  year: 2023
  abstract: "Generating diverse and consistent responses is the ultimate goal of a persona-based dialogue. Although many studies have been conducted, the generated responses tend to be generic and bland due to the personas’ limited descriptiveness. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the given personas for more attractive responses. However, indiscriminate expansion of personas threaten the consistency of responses and therefore reduce the interlocutor’s interest in conversation. To alleviate this issue, we propose a consistent persona expansion framework that improves not only the diversity but also the consistency of persona-based responses. To do so, we define consistency criteria to avoid possible contradictions among personas as follows: 1) Intra-Consistency and 2) Inter-Consistency. Then, we construct a silver profile dataset to deliver the ability to conform with the consistency criteria to the expansion model. Finally, we propose a persona expansion model with an encoder-decoder structure, which considers the relatedness and consistency among personas. Our experiments on the Persona-Chat dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework."

  title: "Concept-based Persona Expansion for Improving Diversity of Persona-Grounded Dialogue"
  conf: "The 17th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics(EACL). (2023)"
  year: 2023
  abstract: "A persona-grounded dialogue model aims to improve the quality of responses to promote user engagement. However, because the given personas are mostly short and limited to only a few informative words, it is challenging to utilize them to generate diverse responses. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel persona expansion framework, Concept-based Persona eXpansion (CPX). CPX takes the original persona as input and generates expanded personas that contain conceptually rich content. We constitute CPX with two task modules: 1) Concept Extractor and 2) Sentence Generator. To train these modules, we exploit the duality of two tasks with a commonsense dataset consisting of a concept set and the corresponding sentences which contain the given concepts. Extensive experiments on persona expansion and response generation show that our work sufficiently contributes to improving the quality of responses in diversity and richness."

  title: "Call for Customized Conversation: Customized Conversation Grounding Persona and Knowledge"
  conf: "Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence(AAAI). (2022)"
  year: 2022
  abstract: "Humans usually have conversations by making use of prior knowledge about a topic and background information of the people whom they are talking to. However, existing conversational agents and datasets do not consider such comprehensive information, and thus they have a limitation in generating the utterances where the knowledge and persona are fused properly. To address this issue, we introduce a call For Customized conversation (FoCus) dataset where the customized answers are built with the user's persona and Wikipedia knowledge. To evaluate the abilities to make informative and customized utterances of pre-trained language models, we utilize BART and GPT-2 as well as transformer-based models. We assess their generation abilities with automatic scores and conduct human evaluations for qualitative results. We examine whether the model reflects adequate persona and knowledge with our proposed two sub-tasks, persona grounding (PG) and knowledge grounding (KG). Moreover, we show that the utterances of our data are constructed with the proper knowledge and persona through grounding quality assessment."

  title: "Active Learning for Knowledge Graph Schema Expansion"
  conf: "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE), Vol. 32, Issue 12, pp. 5610-5620"
  year: 2022
  abstract: "Both entity typing and relation extraction from text corpora are widely used to identify the semantic types of an entity and a relation in a knowledge graph (KG). Most existing approaches rely on a pre-defined set of entity types and relation types in a KG. They thus cannot map entity mentions (relation mentions) to unseen entity types (relation types). To fundamentally overcome the limitations, we should add new semantic types of entities and relations to a KG schema. However, schema expansion traditionally requires manual conceptualization through a user’s observation on the text corpus while assuming the existence of suitable target KG schemas. In this work, we propose an A ctive learning framework for K nowledge graph S chema E xpansion ( AKSE ), which can generate a new semantic type for KG schemas, without depending on a set of target schemas and human users’ observation. Specifically, a granularity based active learning algorithm determines whether a KG schema requires new semantic types or not. We also introduce a KG schema attention-based neural method which assigns semantic types to the entities and relationships extracted. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first study to expand a KG schema with active learning."

  title: "You Truly Understand What I Need: Intellectual and Friendly Dialogue Agents grounding Knowledge and Persona"
  conf: "The 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing(EMNLP) (2022)"
  year: 2022
  abstract: "To build a conversational agent that interacts fluently with humans, previous studies blend knowledge or personal profile into the pre-trained language model. However, the model that considers knowledge and persona at the same time is still limited, leading to hallucination and a passive way of using personas. We propose an effective dialogue agent that grounds external knowledge and persona simultaneously. The agent selects the proper knowledge and persona to use for generating the answers with our candidate scoring implemented with a poly-encoder. Then, our model generates the utterance with lesser hallucination and more engagingness utilizing retrieval augmented generation with knowledge-persona enhanced query. We conduct experiments on the personaknowledge chat and achieve state-of-the-art performance in grounding and generation tasks on the automatic metrics. Moreover, we validate the answers from the models regarding hallucination and engagingness through human evaluation and qualitative results. We show our retriever’s effectiveness in extracting relevant documents compared to the other previous retrievers, along with the comparison of multiple candidate scoring methods.

  title: "HaRiM+: Evaluating Summary Quality with Hallucination Risk"
  conf: "AACL 2022"
  year: 2022
  abstract: "One of the challenges of developing a summarization model arises from the difficulty in measuring the factual inconsistency of the generated text. In this study, we reinterpret the decoder overconfidence-regularizing objective suggested in (Miao et al., 2021) as a hallucination risk measurement to better estimate the quality of generated summaries. We propose a reference-free metric, HaRiM+, which only requires an off-the-shelf summarization model to compute the hallucination risk based on token likelihoods. Deploying it requires no additional training of models or ad-hoc modules, which usually need alignment to human judgments. For summary-quality estimation, HaRiM+ records state-of-the-art correlation to human judgment on three summary-quality annotation sets: FRANK, QAGS, and SummEval. We hope that our work, which merits the use of summarization models, facilitates the progress of both automated evaluation and generation of summary."

  conf: "The 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing(EMNLP) (2022)"
  year: 2022
  abstract: "Style control, content preservation, and fluency determine the quality of text style transfer models. To train on a nonparallel corpus, several existing approaches aim to deceive the style discriminator with an adversarial loss. However, adversarial training significantly degrades fluency compared to the other two metrics. In this work, we explain this phenomenon using energy-based interpretation, and leverage a pretrained language model to improve fluency. Specifically, we propose a novel approach which applies the pretrained language model to the text style transfer framework by restructuring the discriminator and the model itself, allowing the generator and the discriminator to also take advantage of the power of the pretrained model. We evaluated our model on three public benchmarks GYAFC, Amazon, and Yelp and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the overall metrics."

  abstract: "This study proposes Semantic-Infused SElective Graph Reasoning (SISER) for fact verification, which newly presents semantic-level graph reasoning and injects its reasoning-enhanced representation into other
  types of graph-based and sequence-based reasoning methods. SISER combines three reasoning types: 1) semantic-level graph reasoning, which uses a semantic graph from evidence sentences, whose nodes are elements of a triple – <Subject, Verb, Object>, 2)“semantic-infused” sentence-level “selective” graph reasoning, which combine semanticlevel and sentence-level representations and perform graph reasoning in a selective manner using the node selection mechanism, and 3) sequence reasoning, which concatenates all evidence sentences and performs attentionbased reasoning. Experiment results on a large-scale dataset for Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) show that SISER outperforms the previous graph-based approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance."

  title: "A semantic-based video scene segmentation using a deep neural network"
  conf: "Journal of Information Science 45(6)"
  year: 2019
  abstract: "Video scene segmentation is very important research in the field of computer vision, because it helps in efficient storage, indexing and retrieval of videos. Achieving this kind of scene segmentation cannot be done by just calculating the similarity of low-level features presented in the video; high-level features should also be considered to achieve a better performance. Even though much research has been conducted on video scene segmentation, most of these studies failed to semantically segment a video into scenes. Thus, in this study, we propose a Deep-learning Semantic-based Scene-segmentation model (called DeepSSS) that considers image captioning to segment a video into scenes semantically. First, the DeepSSS performs shot boundary detection by comparing colour histograms and then employs maximum-entropy-applied keyframe extraction. Second, for semantic analysis, using image captioning that benefits from deep learning generates a semantic text description of the keyframes. Finally, by comparing and analysing the generated texts, it assembles the keyframes into a scene grouped under a semantic narrative. That said, DeepSSS considers both low- and high-level features of videos to achieve a more meaningful scene segmentation. By applying DeepSSS to data sets from MS COCO for caption generation and evaluating its semantic scene-segmentation task results with the data sets from TRECVid 2016, we demonstrate quantitatively that DeepSSS outperforms other existing scene-segmentation methods using shot boundary detection and keyframes. What’s more, the experiments were done by comparing scenes segmented by humans and scene segmented by the DeepSSS. The results verified that the DeepSSS’ segmentation resembled that of humans. This is a new kind of result that was enabled by semantic analysis, which was impossible by just using low-level features of videos."

  abstract: "Generative chatbot models based on sequence-to-sequence networks can generate natural conversation interactions if a huge dialogue corpus is used as training data. However, except for a few languages such as English and Chinese, it remains difficult to collect a large dialogue corpus. To address this problem, we propose a chatbot model using a mixture of words and syllables as encoding-decoding units. In addition, we propose a two-step training method, involving pre-training using a large non-dialogue corpus and re-training using a small dialogue corpus. In our experiments, the mixture units were shown to help reduce out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problems. Moreover, the two-step training method was effective in reducing grammatical and semantical errors in responses when the chatbot was trained using a small dialogue corpus (533,997 sentence pairs)."

  conf: "IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) (2023)"
  year: 2023
  abstract: "Transformer is eminently suitable for auto-regressive image synthesis which predicts discrete value from the past values recursively to make up full image.Especially, combined with vector quantised latent representation, the state-of-the-art auto-regressive transformer displays realistic high-resolution images. However, sampling the latent code from discrete probability distribution makes the output unpredictable. Therefore, it requires to generate lots of diverse samples to acquire desired outputs.To alleviate the process of generating lots of samples repetitively, in this article, we propose to take a desired output, a style image, as an additional condition without re-training the transformer. To this end, our method transfers the style to a probability constraint to re-balance the prior, thereby specifying the target distribution instead of the original prior. Thus, generated samples from the re-balanced prior have similar styles to reference style.In practice, we can choose either an image or a category of images as an additional condition. In our qualitative assessment, we show that styles of majority of outputs are similar to the input style."

  year: 2023
  abstract: "Compared to joint position, the accuracy of joint rotation and shape estimation has received relatively little attention in the skinned multi-person linear model (SMPL)-based human mesh reconstruction from multi-view images. The work in this field is broadly classified into two categories. The first approach performs joint estimation and then produces SMPL parameters by fitting SMPL to resultant joints. The second approach regresses SMPL parameters directly from the input images through a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model. However, these approaches suffer from the lack of information for resolving the ambiguity of joint rotation and shape reconstruction and the difficulty of network learning. To solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a two-stage method. The proposed method first estimates the coordinates of mesh vertices through a CNN-based model from input images, and acquires SMPL parameters by fitting the SMPL model to the estimated vertices. Estimated mesh vertices provide sufficient information for determining joint rotation and shape, and are easier to learn than SMPL parameters. According to experiments using Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, the proposed method significantly outperforms the previous works in terms of joint rotation and shape estimation, and achieves competitive performance in terms of joint location estimation."

  title: "HybridMatch: Semi-supervised Facial Landmark Detection via Hybrid Heatmap Representations"
  conf: "IEEE Access 2023"
  year: 2023
  abstract: "Facial landmark detection is an essential task in face-processing techniques. Traditional methods, however, require expensive pixel-level labels. Semi-supervised facial landmark detection has been explored as an alternative, but previous approaches only focus on training-oriented issues (e.g., noisy pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning), neglecting task-oriented issues (i.e., the quantization error in landmark detection). We argue that semi-supervised landmark detectors should resolve the two technical issues simultaneously. Through a simple experiment, we found that task- and training-oriented solutions may negatively influence each other, thus eliminating their negative interactions is important. To this end, we devise a new heatmap regression framework via hybrid representation, namely HybridMatch. We utilize both 1-D and 2-D heatmap representations. Here, the 1-D and 2-D heatmaps help alleviate the taskoriented and training-oriented issues, respectively. To exploit the advantages of our hybrid representation, we introduce curriculum learning; relying more on the 2-D heatmap at the early training stage and gradually increasing the effects of the 1-D heatmap. By resolving the two issues simultaneously, we can capture more precise landmark points than existing methods with only a few annotated data. Extensive experiments show that HybridMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets, especially showing 26.3% NME improvement over the existing method in the 300-W full set at 5% data ratio. Surprisingly, our method records a comparable performance, 5.04 (challenging set in the 300-W) to the fully-supervised facial landmark detector 5.03. The remarkable performance of HybridMatch shows its potential as a practical alternative to the fully-supervised model."

  conf: "INTERSPEECH 2022"
  year: 2022
  abstract: "The recently developed pitch-controllable text-to-speech (TTS) model, i.e. FastPitch, was conditioned for the pitch contours. However, the quality of the synthesized speech degraded considerably for pitch values that deviated significantly from the average pitch; i.e. the ability to control pitch was limited. To address this issue, we propose two algorithms to improve the robustness of FastPitch. First, we propose a novel timbre-preserving pitch-shifting algorithm for natural pitch augmentation. Pitch-shifted speech samples sound more natural when using the proposed algorithm because the speaker's vocal timbre is maintained. Moreover, we propose a training algorithm that defines FastPitch using pitch-augmented speech datasets with different pitch ranges for the same sentence. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms improve the pitch controllability of FastPitch."

  abstract: "This paper proposes a hierarchical and multi-scale variational autoencoder-based non-autoregressive text-to-speech model (HiMuV-TTS) to generate natural speech with diverse speaking styles. Recent advances in non-autoregressive TTS (NAR-TTS) models have significantly improved the inference speed and robustness of synthesized speech. However, the diversity of speaking styles and naturalness are needed to be improved. To solve this problem, we propose the HiMuV-TTS model that first determines the global-scale prosody and then determines the local-scale prosody via conditioning on the global-scale prosody and the learned text representation. In addition, we improve the quality of speech by adopting the adversarial training technique. Experimental results verify that the proposed HiMuV-TTS model can generate more diverse and natural speech as compared to TTS models with single-scale variational autoencoders, and can represent different prosody information in each scale."

However, parametric vocoders have limitations of voice quality and the mel-spectrogram features are difficult to model because the timbre and pitch information are entangled. In this study, we propose a singing voice synthesis model with multi-task learning to use both approaches -- acoustic features for a parametric vocoder and mel-spectrograms for a neural vocoder. By using the parametric vocoder features as auxiliary features, the proposed model can efficiently disentangle and control the timbre and pitch components of the mel-spectrogram. Moreover, a generative adversarial network framework is applied to improve the quality of singing voices in a multi-singer model. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model can generate more natural singing voices than the single-task models, while performing better than the conventional parametric vocoder-based model."

  title: "Learning Virtual Chimeras by Dynamic Motion Reassembly"
  conf: "SIGGRAPH Asia 2022"
  year: 2022
  abstract: "The Chimera is a mythological hybrid creature composed of different animal parts. The chimera’s movements are highly dependent on the spatial and temporal alignments of its composing parts. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that creates and animates chimeras by dynamically reassembling source characters and their movements. Our algorithm exploits a two-network architecture: part assembler and dynamic controller. The part assembler is a supervised learning layer that searches for the spatial alignment among body parts, assuming that the temporal alignment is provided. The dynamic controller is a reinforcement learning layer that learns robust control policy for a wide variety of potential temporal alignments. These two layers are tightly intertwined and learned simultaneously. The chimera animation generated by our algorithm is energy efficient and expressive in terms of describing weight shifting, balancing, and full-body coordination. We demonstrate the versatility of our algorithm by generating the motor skills of a large variety of chimeras from limited source characters."

  title: "Neural Architecture Adaptation for Object Detection by Searching Channel Dimensions and Mapping Pre-trained Parameters"
  conf: "International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) (2022)"
  year: 2022
  abstract: "Most object detection frameworks use backbone architectures originally designed for image classification, conventionally with pre-trained parameters on ImageNet. However, image classification and object detection are essentially different tasks and there is no guarantee that the optimal backbone for classification is also optimal for object detection. Recent neural architecture search (NAS) research has demonstrated that automatically designing a backbone specifically for object detection helps improve the overall accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a neural architecture adaptation method that can optimize the given backbone for detection purposes, while still allowing the use of pre-trained parameters. We propose to adapt both the micro- and macro-architecture by searching for specific operations and the number of layers, in addition to the output channel dimensions of each block. It is important to find the optimal channel depth, as it greatly affects the feature representation capability and computation cost. We conduct experiments with our searched backbone for object detection and demonstrate that our backbone outperforms both manually designed and searched state-of-the-art backbones on the COCO dataset."

  abstract: "Despite recent success in conditional image synthesis, prevalent input conditions such as semantics and edges are not clear enough to express ‘Linear (Ridges)’ and ‘Planar (Scale)’ representations. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework StyLandGAN, which synthesizes desired landscape images using a depth map which has higher expressive power. Our StyleLandGAN is extended from the unconditional generation model to accept input conditions. We also propose a ’2-phase inference’ pipeline which generates diverse depth maps and shifts local parts so that it can easily reflect user’s intend. As a comparison, we modified the existing semantic image synthesis models to accept a depth map as well. Experimental results show that our method is superior to existing methods in quality, diversity, and depth-accuracy."

  conf: "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR) (2022)"
  year: 2022
  abstract: "The task of predicting future actions from a video is crucial for a real-world agent interacting with others. When anticipating actions in the distant future, we humans typically consider long-term relations over the whole sequence of actions, i.e., not only observed actions in the past but also potential actions in the future. In a similar spirit, we propose an end-to-end attention model for action anticipation, dubbed Future Transformer (FUTR), that leverages global attention over all input frames and output tokens to predict a minutes-long sequence of future actions. Unlike the previous autoregressive models, the proposed method learns to predict the whole sequence of future actions in parallel decoding, enabling more accurate and fast inference for longterm anticipation. We evaluate our method on two standard benchmarks for long-term action anticipation, Breakfast and 50 Salads, achieving state-of-the-art results."

  abstract: "Reinforcement learning (RL) combined with deep neural networks has performed remarkably well in many genres of games recently. It has surpassed human-level performance in fixed game environments and turn-based two-player board games. However, to the best of our knowledge, current research has yet to produce a result that has surpassed human-level performance in modern complex fighting games. This is due to the inherent difficulties with real-time fighting games, including: vast action spaces, action dependencies, and imperfect information. We overcame these challenges and made 1v1 battle AI agents for the commercial game Blade and Soul . The trained agents competed against five professional gamers and achieved a winning rate of 62%. This article presents a practical RL method that includes a novel self-play curriculum and data skipping techniques. Through the curriculum, three different styles of agents were created by reward shaping and were trained against each other. Additionally, this article suggests data-skipping techniques that could increase data efficiency and facilitate explorations in vast spaces. Since our method can be generally applied to all two-player competitive games with vast action spaces, we anticipate its application to game development including level design and automated balancing."

  abstract: "Recent advances in neural multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) models have enabled the generation of reasonably good speech quality with a single model and made it possible to synthesize the speech of a speaker with limited training data. Fine-tuning to the target speaker data with the multi-speaker model can achieve better quality, however, there still exists a gap compared to the real speech sample and the model depends on the speaker. In this work, we propose GANSpeech, which is a high-fidelity multi-speaker TTS model that adopts the adversarial training method to a non-autoregressive multi-speaker TTS model. In addition, we propose simple but efficient automatic scaling methods for feature matching loss used in adversarial training. In the subjective listening tests, GANSpeech significantly outperformed the baseline multi-speaker FastSpeech and FastSpeech2 models, and showed a better MOS score than the speaker-specific fine-tuned FastSpeech2."

Prosodic speech can be generated by conditioning acoustic features. However, synthesized speech with a large pitch-shift scale suffers from audio quality degradation, and speaker characteristics deformation. To address this problem, we propose a feed-forward Transformer based TTS model that is designed based on the source-filter theory. This model, called FastPitchFormant, has a unique structure that handles text and acoustic features in parallel. With modeling each feature separately, the tendency that the model learns the relationship between two features can be mitigated."

  abstract: "Recently, end-to-end Korean singing voice systems have been designed to generate realistic singing voices. However, these systems still suffer from a lack of robustness in terms of pronunciation accuracy. In this paper, we propose N-Singer, a non-autoregressive Korean singing voice system, to synthesize accurate and pronounced Korean singing voices in parallel. N-Singer consists of a Transformer-based mel-generator, a convolutional network-based postnet, and voicing-aware discriminators. It can contribute in the following ways. First, for accurate pronunciation, N-Singer separately models linguistic and pitch information without other acoustic features. Second, to achieve improved mel-spectrograms, N-Singer uses a combination of Transformer-based modules and convolutional network-based modules. Third, in adversarial training, voicing-aware conditional discriminators are used to capture the harmonic features of voiced segments and noise components of unvoiced segments. The experimental results prove that N-Singer can synthesize a natural singing voice in parallel with a more accurate pronunciation than the baseline model."

Although the text encoder and audio decoder handle different types and lengths of data (i.e., text and audio), the TNA-TTS models are not designed considering these variations. Therefore, to improve the modeling performance of the TNA-TTS model we propose a hierarchical Transformer structure-based text encoder and audio decoder that are designed to accommodate the characteristics of each module. For the text encoder, we constrain each self-attention layer so the encoder focuses on a text sequence from the local to the global scope. Conversely, the audio decoder constrains its self-attention layers to focus in the reverse direction, i.e., from global to local scope. Additionally, we further improve the pitch modeling accuracy of the audio decoder by providing sentence and word-level pitch as conditions. Various objective and subjective evaluations verified that the proposed method outperformed the baseline TNA-TTS."

  abstract: "Recently, it has become easier to obtain speech data from various media such as the internet or YouTube, but directly utilizing them to train a neural text-to-speech (TTS) model is difficult. The proportion of clean speech is insufficient and the remainder includes background music. Even with the global style token (GST). Therefore, we propose the following method to successfully train an end-to-end TTS model with limited broadcast data. First, the background music is removed from the speech by introducing a music filter. Second, the GST-TTS model with an auxiliary quality classifier is trained with the filtered speech and a small amount of clean speech. In particular, the quality classifier makes the embedding vector of the GST layer focus on representing the speech quality (filtered or clean) of the input speech. The experimental results verified that the proposed method synthesized much more high-quality speech than conventional methods."

  year: 2021
  abstract: "Establishing a human motion reconstruction system from very few constraints imposed on the body has been an interesting and important research topic because it significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to be managed. However, it is a well-known mathematically ill-posed problem as the dimension of constraints is much lower than that of the human pose to be determined. Therefore, it is challenging to directly reconstruct the whole body joint information from very few constraints due to many possible solutions. To address this issue, we present a novel deep learning framework with an attention mechanism using large-scale motion capture (mocap) data for mapping very few user-defined constraints into the human motion as realistically as possible. Our system is built upon the attention networks for looking back further to achieve better results. Experimental results show that our network model is capable of producing more accurate results compared with previous approaches. We also conducted several experiments to test all possible combinations of the features extracted from the mocap data, and found the best feature combination to generate high-quality poses."

Recently, learning-based approaches have successfully been exploited to learn deep network policies for the control of interactive characters. The agility and responsiveness of deep network policies are influenced by many factors, such as the composition of training datasets, the architecture of network models, and learning algorithms that involve many threshold values, weights, and hyper-parameters. In this paper, we present a novel teacher-student framework to learn time-critically responsive policies, which guarantee the time-to-completion between user inputs and their associated responses regardless of the size and composition of the motion databases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with interactive characters that can respond to the user's control quickly while performing agile, highly dynamic movements."

  year: 2021
  abstract: "Capturing human annotators’ subjective responses in image annotation has become crucial as vision-based classifiers expand the range of application areas. While there has been significant progress in image annotation interface design in general, relatively little research has been conducted to understand how to elicit reliable and cost-efficient human annotation when the nature of the task includes a certain level of subjectivity. To bridge this gap, we aim to understand how different sampling methods in image batch labeling, a design that allows human annotators to label a batch of images simultaneously, can impact human annotation performances. In particular, we developed three different strategies in forming image batches: (1) uncertainty-based labeling (UL) that prioritizes images that a classifier predicts with the highest uncertainty, (2) certainty-based labeling(CL), a reverse strategy of UL, and (3) random, a baseline approach that randomly selects images. Although UL and CL solely select images to be labeled from a classifier’s point of view, we hypothesized that human-side perception and labeling performance may also vary depending on the different sampling strategies. In our study, we observed that participants were able to recognize a different level of perceived cognitive load across three conditions (CL the easiest while UL the most difficult). We also observed a trade-off between annotation task effectiveness (CL and UL more reliable than random) and task efficiency (UL the most efficient while CL the least efficient). Based on the results, we discuss the implications of design and possible future research directions of image batch labeling."

  conf: "International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR) (2021)"
  year: 2021
  abstract: "Scene text detection is a challenging task because it must be able to handle text in various fonts and from various perspective views. This makes it difficult to use rectangular bounding boxes to detect text locations accurately. To detect multi-oriented text, rotated bounding box-based methods have been explored as an alternative. However, they are not as accurate for scene text detection as rectangular bounding box-based methods. In this paper, we propose a novel region-proposal network to suggest rotated bounding boxes and an iterative region refinement network for final scene text detection. The proposed regionproposal network predicts rotated box candidates from pixels and anchors, which increases recall by creating more candidates around the text. The proposed refinement network improves the accuracy of scene text detection by correcting the differences in the locations between the ground truth and the prediction. In addition, we reduce the backpropagation time by using a new pooling method called rotated box crop and resize pooling. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ICDAR 2017 and competitive results on ICDAR 2015 and ICDAR 2013. Furthermore, our approach achieves a significant increase in performance over previous methods based on rotated bounding boxes."

  abstract: "Video-text retrieval requires finding an optimal space for comparing the similarity of two different modalities. Most approaches adopt ranking loss as a primary training objective to find the space. The loss is only interested in bringing the samples annotated as pairs closer to each other without considering the semantic relevance of different samples. This rather causes even semantically similar pairs not to get close. To deal with the problem, we propose semanticpreserving metric learning. The proposed method entails the metric space where the similarity ratio between samples is proportional to semantic relevance between annotations. In the extensive experiments on video-text datasets, the proposed method presents a close alignment between the learned metric space and the semantic space. It also demonstrates state-of-the-art retrieval performance."

The proposed method, therefore, uses the recognition ranking of each phoneme segment corresponding to a phoneme sequence for measuring the confidence of a voice-over utterance for its corresponding script.

  abstract: "We present a novel high-fidelity real-time neural vocoder called VocGAN. A recently developed GAN-based vocoder, MelGAN, produces speech waveforms in real-time. However, it often produces a waveform that is insufficient in quality or inconsistent with acoustic characteristics of the input mel spectrogram. VocGAN is nearly as fast as MelGAN, but it significantly improves the quality and consistency of the output waveform. VocGAN applies a multi-scale waveform generator and a hierarchically-nested discriminator to learn multiple levels of acoustic properties in a balanced way. It also applies the joint conditional and unconditional objective, which has shown successful results in high-resolution image synthesis. In experiments, VocGAN synthesizes speech waveforms 416.7x faster on a GTX 1080Ti GPU and 3.24x faster on a CPU than real-time. Compared with MelGAN, it also exhibits significantly improved quality in multiple evaluation metrics including mean opinion score (MOS) with minimal additional overhead. Additionally, compared with Parallel WaveGAN, another recently developed high-fidelity vocoder, VocGAN is 6.98x faster on a CPU and exhibits higher MOS."

  abstract: "This paper proposes a controllable end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) system to control the speaking speed (speed-controllable TTS; SCTTS) of synthesized speech with sentence-level speaking-rate value as an additional input. The speaking-rate value, the ratio of the number of input phonemes to the length of input speech, is adopted in the proposed system to control the speaking speed. Furthermore, the proposed SCTTS system can control the speaking speed while retaining other speech attributes, such as the pitch, by adopting the global style token-based style encoder. The proposed SCTTS does not require any additional well-trained model or an external speech database to extract phoneme-level duration information and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. In addition, our listening tests on fast-, normal-, and slow-speed speech showed that the SCTTS can generate more natural speech than other phoneme duration control approaches which increase or decrease duration at the same rate for the entire sentence, especially in the case of slow-speed speech."

  year: 2020
  abstract: "In this paper, we propose an effective technique to transplant a source speaker’s emotional expression to a new target speaker’s voice within an end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) framework. We modify an expressive TTS model pre-trained using a source speaker’s emotional speech database to reflect the voice characteristics of a target speaker for which only a neutral speech database is available. We set two adaptation criteria to achieve this. One criterion is to minimize the reconstruction loss between the target speaker’s recorded and synthesized speech, such that the synthesized speech has the target speaker’s voice characteristics. The other criterion is to minimize the emotion loss between the emotion embedding vectors extracted from the reference expressive speech and the target speaker’s synthesized expressive speech, which is essential to preserve expressiveness. Since the two criteria are applied alternately in the adaptation process, we are able to avoid the kind of bias issues frequently encountered in similar tasks. The proposed adaptation technique demonstrates more effective performance compared to conventional approaches in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations."

  title: "A Robust Low-cost Mocap System with Sparse Sensors"
  conf: "SIGGRAPH Asia (2020) (Poster Session)"
  year: 2020
  abstract: "In this paper, we propose a robust low-cost mocap system (mocap) with sparse sensors. Although the sensor with an accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope is cost-effective and offers the measured positions and rotations from these devices, it potentially suffers from noise, drift, and lost issues over time. The resulting character obtained from a sensor-based low-cost mocap system is thus generally not satisfactory. We address these issues by using a novel deep learning framework that consists of two networks, a motion estimator and a sensor data generator. When the aforementioned issues occur, the motion estimator feeds the newly synthesized sensor data obtained with the measured and predicted data from the sensor data generator until the issues have been resolved. Otherwise, the motion estimator receives the measured sensor data to accurately and continuously reconstruct the new character poses. In our examples, we show that our system outperforms the previous approach without the sensor data generator and we believe that it can be considered a handy and robust mocap system."

  conf: "International Conference on Computer Animation and Social Agents (CASA) (2020) (Best Paper Nominee), SIGGRAPH Asia (2018) (Poster Session)"
  year: 2018
  abstract: "Motion retargeting is the process of copying motion from one character (source) to another (target) when the source and target body sizes and proportions (of arms, legs, torso, etc.) are different. The problem of automatic motion retargeting has been studied for several decades; however, the motion quality obtained with the application of current approaches is on occasion unrealistic. This is because previous methods, which are mainly based on numerical optimization, generally do not incorporate prior knowledge of the details and nuances of human movements. To address these issues, we present a novel human motion retargeting system using a deep learning framework with large-scale motion data to produce high-quality retargeted human motion. We establish a deep-learning-based motion retargeting system using a variational deep autoencoder combining the deep convolutional inverse graphics network (DC-IGN) and the U-Net. The DC-IGN is utilized for disentangling the motion of each body part, while the U-Net is employed to preserve details of the original motion. We conduct several experiments to validate the proposed motion retargeting system, and find that ours achieves better accuracy along with reduced computational burden when compared with the conventional motion retargeting approach and other neural network architectures."

Notably, highlight videos of sports are in considerable demand from viewers. We propose a highlight-video generation system for baseball games. The original video, along with the game log, is used to rapidly and accurately extract trimmed event video using simple computer vision algorithms. Several types of highlight videos can be generated by extracting all the trimmed event videos and combining them in various manners. Experimental results show that the proposed method has 98.18% accuracy in trimmed event video extraction.

The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters."

  abstract: "In this paper, we propose a novel method of denoising human motion using a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) with an attention mechanism. The corrupted motion that is captured from a single 3D depth sensor camera is automatically fixed in the well-established smooth motion manifold. Incorporating an attention mechanism into BRNN achieves better optimization results and higher accuracy because a higher weight value is selectively given to the more important input pose at a specific frame for encoding the input motion when compared to other deep learning frameworks. The results show that our approach efficiently handles various types of motion and noise. We also experiment with different features to find the best feature and believe that our method will be sufficiently desirable to be used in motion capture applications as a post-processing step after capturing human motion."

We adopted deep neural networks and replaced the iterative process with the feed-forward inference consisting of simple matrix multiplications. For efficient mapping from contact constraints to character motion, the proposed system is composed of two types of networks: trajectory and pose generators. The networks are trained using augmented motion capture data and are fine-tuned using the inverse kinematics loss. In experiments, our system successfully generates multi-contact motions of a hundred of characters in real-time, and the result motions contain the naturalness existing in the motion capture data."

  year: 2018
  abstract: "The task of answering a question given a text passage has shown great developments on model performance thanks to community efforts in building useful datasets. Recently, there have been doubts whether such rapid progress has been based on truly understanding language. The same question has not been asked in the table question answering (TableQA) task, where we are tasked to answer a query given a table. We show that existing efforts, of using “answers” for both evaluation and supervision for TableQA, show deteriorating performances in adversarial settings of perturbations that do not affect the answer. This insight naturally motivates to develop new models that understand question and table more precisely. For this goal, we propose Neural Operator (NeOp), a multi-layer sequential network with attention supervision to answer the query given a table. NeOp uses multiple Selective Recurrent Units (SelRUs) to further help the interpretability of the answers of the model. Experiments show that the use of operand information to train the model significantly improves the performance and interpretability of TableQA models.NeOp outperforms all the previous models by a big margin."

  year: 2019
  abstract: "This paper proposes a recommender system to alleviate the cold-start problem that can estimate user preferences based on only a small number of items. To identify a user's preference in the cold state, existing recommender systems, such as Netflix, initially provide items to a user; we call those items evidence candidates. Recommendations are then made based on the items selected by the user. Previous recommendation studies have two limitations: (1) the users who consumed a few items have poor recommendations and (2) inadequate evidence candidates are used to identify user preferences. We propose a meta-learning-based recommender system called MeLU to overcome these two limitations. From meta-learning, which can rapidly adopt new task with a few examples, MeLU can estimate new user's preferences with a few consumed items. In addition, we provide an evidence candidate selection strategy that determines distinguishing items for customized preference estimation. We validate MeLU with two benchmark datasets, and the proposed model reduces at least 5.92% mean absolute error than two comparative models on the datasets. We also conduct a user study experiment to verify the evidence selection strategy."

  abstract: "Existing machine reading comprehension models are reported to be brittle for adversarially perturbed questions when optimizing only for accuracy, which led to the creation of new reading comprehension benchmarks, such as SQuAD 2.0 which contains such type of questions. However, despite the super-human accuracy of existing models on such datasets, it is still unclear how the model predicts the answerability of the question, potentially due to the absence of a shared annotation for the explanation. To address such absence, we release SQuAD2-CR dataset, which contains annotations on unanswerable questions from the SQuAD 2.0 dataset, to enable an explanatory analysis of the model prediction. Specifically, we annotate (1) explanation on why the most plausible answer span cannot be the answer and (2) which part of the question causes unanswerability. We share intuitions and experimental results that how this dataset can be used to analyze and improve the interpretability of existing reading comprehension model behavior."

  title: "CITIES: Contextual Inference of Tail-Item Embeddings for Sequential Recommendation"
  conf: "2020 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM). (2020)"
  year: 2020
  abstract: "Sequential recommendation techniques provide users with product recommendations fitting their current preferences by handling dynamic user preferences over time. Previous studies have focused on modeling sequential dynamics without much regard to which of the best-selling products (i.e., head items) or niche products (i.e., tail items) should be recommended. We scrutinize the structural reason for why tail items are barely served in the current sequential recommendation model, which consists of an item-embedding layer, a sequence-modeling layer, and a recommendation layer. Well-designed sequence-modeling and recommendation layers are expected to naturally learn suitable item embeddings. However, tail items are likely to fall short of this expectation because the current model structure is not suitable for learning high-quality embeddings with insufficient data. Thus, tail items are rarely recommended. To eliminate this issue, we propose a framework called CITIES, which aims to enhance the quality of the tail-item embeddings by training an embedding-inference function using multiple contextual head items so that the recommendation performance improves for not only the tail items but also for the head items. Moreover, our framework can infer new-item embeddings without an additional learning process. Extensive experiments on two realworld datasets show that applying CITIES to the state-of-the-art methods improves recommendation performance for both tail and head items. We conduct an additional experiment to verify that CITIES can infer suitable new-item embeddings as well."

  abstract: "Recently, opinion summarization, which is the generation of a summary from multiple reviews, has been conducted in a self-supervised manner by considering a sampled review as a pseudo summary. However, non-text data such as image and metadata related to reviews have been considered less often. To use the abundant information contained in non-text data, we propose a self-supervised multimodal opinion summarization framework called MultimodalSum. Our framework obtains a representation of each modality using a separate encoder for each modality, and the text decoder generates a summary. To resolve the inherent heterogeneity of multimodal data, we propose a multimodal training pipeline. We first pretrain the text encoder–decoder based solely on text modality data. Subsequently, we pretrain the non-text modality encoders by considering the pretrained text decoder as a pivot for the homogeneous representation of multimodal data. Finally, to fuse multimodal representations, we train the entire framework in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate the superiority of MultimodalSum by conducting experiments on Yelp and Amazon datasets."

  abstract: "How can we classify graph-structured data only with positive labels? Graph-based positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is to train a binary classifier given only the positive labels when the relationship between examples is given as a graph. The problem is of great importance for various tasks such as detecting malicious accounts in a social network, which are difficult to be modeled by supervised learning when the true negative labels are absent.

GRAB models a given graph as a Markov network and runs the marginalization and update steps iteratively. The marginalization step estimates the marginals of latent variables, while the update step trains a classifier network utilizing the computed priors in the objective function.

We empirically demonstrate that our method shows fast computations and low memory requirements comparable to other most efficient baselines. Furthermore, our method simultaneously considers all possible perturbing directions so as not to misestimate the perturbation effect. Our ablation study shows that considering all possible perturbing directions is crucial to obtain a correct saliency map. Lastly, our method exhibits competitive performance on the benchmarks in evaluating the pixel-level saliency map."

  conf: "Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). (2022)"
  year: 2022
  abstract: "Modern recommendation systems are mostly based on implicit feedback data which can be quite noisy due to false positives (FPs) caused by many reasons, such as misclicks or quick curiosity. Numerous recommendation algorithms based on collaborative filtering have leveraged post-click user behavior (eg, skip) to identify false positives. They effectively involved these false positives in the model supervision as negative-like signals. Yet, false positives had not been considered in existing session-based recommendation systems (SBRs) although they provide just as deleterious effects. To resolve false positives in SBRs, we first introduce FP-Metric model which reformulates the objective of the session-based recommendation with FP constraints into metric learning regularization. In addition, we propose FP-AdaMetric that enhances the metric-learning regularization terms with an adaptive module that elaborately calculates the impact of FPs inside sequential patterns. We verify that FP-AdaMetric improves several session-based recommendation models' performances in terms of Hit Rate (HR), MRR, and NDCG on datasets from different domains including music, movie, and game. Furthermore, we show that the adaptive module plays a much more crucial role in FP-AdaMetric model than in other baselines."

  conf: "IEEE Access 2023"
  year: 2023
  abstract: "Existing methods for generating virtual character videos focus on improving either appearance or motion. However, achieving both photo- and motion-realistic characters is critical in real services. To address both aspects, we propose Fake to Real Portrait Control (F2RPC), a unified framework for image destylization and face reenactment. F2RPC employs a blind face restoration model to circumvent GAN inversion limitations, such as identity loss and alignment sensitivity, while preserving GAN’s generation quality. This framework includes two novel sub-modules, AdaGPEN for destylization and PCGPEN for reenactment, both leveraging the same restoration model as a backbone. AdaGPEN exploits GAN prior of the restoration model via blending features from the original and its blurred image using the AdaMix block. PCGPEN  reenacts  the  input  image  to  follow  the  input  motion  condition  via  flow-based  feature  editing. These  components  function  in  an  end-to-end  manner,  enhancing  efficiency  and  lowering  computational overhead. We evaluate F2RPC using synthetic character dataset and high-resolution talking face datasets for destylization and reenactment, respectively. The results show that F2RPC outperforms the combined use of state-of-the-art methods for destylization (i.e., DualStyleGAN) and reenactment (i.e., StyleHEAT). F2RPCimproves the FID by 26.4% and preserves identity similarity by 95% more at a resolution of512×512video."

  abstract: "We present a novel generative model, called Bidirectional GaitNet, that learns the relationship between human anatomy and its gait. The simulation model of human anatomy is a comprehensive, full-body, simulation-ready, musculoskeletal model with 304 Hill-type musculotendon units. The Bidirectional GaitNet consists of forward and backward models. The forward model predicts a gait pattern of a person with specific physical conditions, while the backward model estimates the physical conditions of a person when his/her gait pattern is provided. Our simulation-based approach first learns the forward model by distilling the simulation data generated by a state-of-the-art predictive gait simulator and then constructs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with the learned forward model as its decoder. Once it is learned its encoder serves as the backward model. We demonstrate our model on a variety of healthy/impaired gaits and validate it in comparison with physical examination data of real patients."
